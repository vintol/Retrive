Retrieve
=======

A quick and efficient downloader to retrieve bulk of small files

Purpose (User Cases)
--------

The main purpose of retrieve is to efficiently download links scraped by [fanboy](https://github.com/vintol/fanboy/)

- It can be used to download generally small files (<2 MB) in large no (>50)
- Specially useful if you have these file grouped and would like to retain that structure.


The original intention was to download the files scraped by my other project `fanboy`, while retaining the album grouping.
But later on, this became a project on its own and I started adding relevent features.
